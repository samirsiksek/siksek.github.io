"Elliptic Curves over Real Quadratic Fields are Modular",
by Nuno Freitas, Bao Le Hung, Samir Siksek.

====================================================

gl.txt    	For p=3,5,7, determines the odd irreducible subgroups
	  	of GL_2(F_p) having surjective determinant, and whose
		intersection with SL_2(F_p) is absolutely reducible.

====================================================

Xb3b5.txt   	Checks the correctness of the model for X(b3,b5)=X_0(15) 
	 	 		and j-map X(b3,b5) --> X(1) given by the MAGMA 
	  			"small curves database".

===================================================

Xs3b5.txt   	Gives a model for X(s3,b5) and the j-map.

==================================================

Xd7.txt     	Derives a model for X(d7) and the j-map, 
				and verifies that they are equivalent to 
				the model and j-map given by Elkies.

==================================================

Xe7.txt     	Derives a model for X(e7) and the j-map.

==================================================

Xb5b7.txt   	Computations on X(b5,b7)

==================================================

Xb3s5.txt   	Computations on X(b3,s5)

=================================================

Xs3s5.txt	  	Computations on X(s3,s5)

=================================================

Qsqrt5.txt  	Computations for showing that elliptic curves 
				over $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ are modular.

=================================================

sieve.txt        A sieve for quadratic points on
	       X(b3,b5,d7)
	       X(s3,b5,d7)
	       X(b3,b5,e7)
               X(s3,b5,e7)
