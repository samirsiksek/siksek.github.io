Title:
 Density of rational points on diagonal quartic surfaces

 Abstract:
 It is a wide open question whether the set of rational points
 on a smooth quartic surface in projective three-space can be
 nonempty, yet finite. In this talk I will treat the case of diagonal
 quartics V, which are given by ax^4+by^4+cz^4+dw^4=0 for
 some nonzero rational a,b,c,d. I will assume that the product
 abcd is a square and that V contains at least one rational
 point P. I will prove that if none of the coordinates of P is zero,
 and P is not contained in one of the 48 lines on V, then the
 set of rational points on V is dense. This is based on joint work
 with Adam Logan and David McKinnon.

Title: Insufficiency of the Brauer-Manin obstruction applied to \'etale
 covers

Abstract:
Let $k$ be any global field of characteristic not~$2$.
We construct a $k$-variety $X$ such that $X(k)$ is empty, 
but for which the emptiness cannot be explained 
by the Brauer-Manin obstruction
or even by the Brauer-Manin obstruction applied to finite \'etale
 covers.

Title. Sha and Degree 4 del Pezzo Surfaces.

Abstract.
It is known that, given a genus 2 curve C : y^2 = f(x), where
f(x) is quintic and defined over a number field K,
and given a homogeneous space H_delta for complete 2-descent
on the Jacobian of of C, one can derive a related V_delta
which is a degree 4 del Pezzo surface defined over K.
We shall describe explicitly how, given V, to find C and delta
such that V = V_delta, up to a linear change in variable defined
over K. We shall also apply this relationship to Hurlimann's
example of a degree 4 del Pezzo surface violating the Hasse principle,
and derive an explicit parametrised infinite family of
genus 2 curves, defined over Q, whose Jacobians have nontrivial
members of the Shafarevich-Tate group. This example will differ from
previous examples in the literature by having only two Q-rational
Weierstrass points.

 'Computations about the Tate-Shafarevich group using Iwasawa theory'

 Abstract :
 'I shall explain how to combine deep results from Iwasawa theory
  (Kato, Perrin-Riou, Schneider,...) with explicit computation to
  obtain information about $p$-primary parts of Tate-Shafarevich
  groups of elliptic curves over $\QQ$.  This method provides a
  practical way to compute $\#\Sha(E/\QQ)(p)$ in many cases when
  traditional $p$-descent methods are completely impractical and
  when the rank of $E(\QQ)$ is greater than 1.'

"Very free rational points"

Abstract
The analogy between number fields and function fields
of curves is a truism of arithmetic geometry.
It is therefore natural to look for links between the
asymptotic behaviour of points of bounded height on a variety
and the geometry of the moduli space of morphisms of high degree
from a curve to this variety.

On the geometric side, this study lead to new
results about the curves on split flag varieties or
toric varieties.

On the arithmetic side,
it has opened a trail towards a better understanding of
the geometric obstructions for the Batyrev-Manin's principle
which were first unearthed in the counter-example of Batyrev
and Tschinkel:
the natural objects for geometry are the very free curves,
similarly one is lead in diophantine geometry to look
for very free rational points.
