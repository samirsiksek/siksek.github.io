Title: Undecidability in number theory <br>
Abstract:
Hilbert's Tenth Problem asked for an algorithm that, given a
multivariable polynomial equation with integer coefficients, would
decide whether there exists a solution in integers.  Around 1970,
Matiyasevich, building on earlier work of Davis, Putnam, and Robinson,
showed that no such algorithm exists.  But the answer to the analogous
question with Z replaced by Q is still unknown, and there is not even
agreement among experts as to what the answer should be.  I will
discuss this and Hilbert's Tenth Problem over other rings of
arithmetic interest. <br><br>
