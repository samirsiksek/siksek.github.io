Background</b>
</font>
</h2>
<p>
Suppose <i>X</i> is a curve defined over <b>Q</b> with <i>X</i>(<b>Q</b>)
non-empty. Then it known that <i>X</i>(<b>Q</b>) is either parametrizable
or a finitely-generated abelian group or a finite set according to whether
the genus of <i>X</i> is 0, 1, or at least 2. This is an example
of how geometry determines arithmetic. 
</p>

<p> Yet, there is still no algorithm, which given a curve <i>X</i>
of genus at least 1, is guaranteed to determine whether <i>X</i>(<b>Q</b>) is non-empty.
Moreover, even if <i>X</i>(<b>Q</b>) is non-empty, there is no known algorithm
guaranteed to determine the basis of the Mordell-Weil group in genus 1, or the 
set itself in genus 2. Despite this seemingly bleak outlook, the
last few years have seen the development and refinement of many
viable strategies, which although not guaranteed to answer these
questions in each instance, are likely to be successful in doing so. 
</p>


<p> For varieties of higher dimension, much less is known about 
how the geometry determines the arithmetic, although this has become
a subject of intensive research. Here experimentation is likely to 
provide conjectural partial answers to this fundamental question.

Aims
</font>
</b></h2>
<p>
We bring together many leading experts in the subject and aim to give
them an opportunity to present their latest results and  insights.
To create a situation that leads to fruitful exchange, the participants
include both people working on the theoretical side of the subject, and those
working on the explicit or experimental side.

Through this we hope to achieve a better understanding of the current
state of the art and to provide the basis for animated discussions.
More importantly, we aim to identify and explore the most promising
directions for future work.

<p>
The conference will start on Monday morning and finish on Friday 
at about midday. There will be at most four lectures per day,
to give the participants enough time for discussions
and collaborations.
