<li><b>Monday 21 April, </b> <em> Seminar</em> <br>
Time: 11 &ndash; 12<br>
Room: B3.02<br>
Speaker: <b>Evis Ieronymou</b> (Imperial), <br>
Title: Brauer group of diagonal quartic surfaces, and elements of order 2 <br>
Abstract: We work over the complex numbers, and consider an elliptic
 fibration of a diaqonal quartic surface. We construct elements of the
 Brauer group of the generic fibre, as biquaternion algebras over its
 function field. This is done by considering torsors under Z/2. A key
 fact of the process is that the generic fibre can be given the
 structure
 of a 2-covering of its jacobian, which can be lifted to a 4-covering.
 We
 then check which of the elements thus constructed belong to the Brauer
 group of the original surface. Having constructed one such element we
 then explore its arithmetic applications.
 We show that it provides an obstruction to weak approximation for a
 specific diagonal quartic, over a degree 8 extension of the rational
 numbers. We note that over this extension the algebraic part of the
 Brauer group is trivial. <br><br>

<li><b> Tuesday 22 April  &ndash; 
        Wednesday 23 April, </b> 
<em>Short Course</em><br>
Times and Rooms: Tuesday 10 &ndash; 11, 12 &ndash; 1, B3.02 <br>
Wednesday 10 &ndash; 11,
12 &ndash; 1,
B3.02<br>
Speaker: <b>Johan Bosman</b> (Leiden)<br>
Title: Galois Representations of Modular Forms <br>
Abstract: In this short course we will start by giving an introduction to
 classical 
modular forms and Galois representations associated to them. In the end
 of 
the course we will discuss some results in Bas Edixhoven's project on
 the 
computation of coefficients of modular forms. Included topics are:
 Hecke 
operators, modular curves and Serre's conjecture. Knowlegde of modular 
forms is not required to understand the lectures.

<li><b> Friday 25 April, </b> <em> Mathematics Institute Colloquium</em><br>
Time: 4 &ndash; 5<br>
Room: B3.02<br>
Speaker: <b>Tom Fisher</b> (Cambridge) <br>
Title: The Arithmetic of Plane Cubics<br>
Abstract: In this talk I will describe the process of 3-descent on
 elliptic 
curves over the rationals, as has recently been made more explicit in
 joint 
work with Cremona, O'Neil, Simon and Stoll. I will
begin by reviewing some of the classical geometry related to the
Hesse pencil of plane cubics. I will then define the group of
rational points (or Mordell-Weil group) of an elliptic curve, and
explain how computing its rank is related to searching for rational
points on plane cubics. The aim of a 3-descent calculation is then,
starting from an elliptic curve, to find the relevant plane cubics.
