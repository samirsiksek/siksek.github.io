<p> <H3>Support classes and homework grading</H3>

During the Thursday afternoon lecture, we will hand out a set of exercises.
The students can work on the exercises during the support class; 
Charlie will be there to answer questions and give hints and so on.

<p>
Roughly every other week, the exercises handed out are <b>assessed homework</b>, 
which means the following:
Every student selects <b>three exercises</b> from the set, to be handed in
<b>within one week</b>.  This means that the submission deadline
is <b>Thursday 4pm</b>.  If you hand in solutions to more than three exercises,
then only the first three will be marked.<p>
Charlie marks the solutions, giving the student a score of at most 20 points:
up to 6 points for each of the exercises and possibly 2 extra points.
The extra points are awarded if the submission is well readable 
(mathematically as well as typographically) and depend on the amount of 
pleasure experienced reading the solutions.

<H3>Weekly progress</H3>
<dl>
<dt>1. 11th &amp; 13th January:
<dd>We defined algebraic numbers and number fields.  
We treated several applications of the rings Z[sqrt(d)] with
d = -1, d = -19 and d = 3 to solving number theoretic problems.
Units and (failure of) unique factorisation were discussed.
All the examples were based on [Stev, Section 1].
<p>
<dt>2. 18th &amp; 20th January:
<dd>We recalled basic concepts from algebra: field extensions 
(degrees, algebraic elements) and
commutative rings (modules, ring extensions, integral elements).
We defined algebraic integers and 
computed the rings of integers of quadratic number fields.
Most of this can be found in [StewTa, Chapter 1 and Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 3.1].
<p>
<dt>3. 25th &amp; 27th January:
<dd>We defined the complex embeddings of a number field.  Norms and traces were also defined.
A number field is a finite dimensional <b>Q</b>-vector space and its elements act linearly on it
by multiplication.  We exploited this structure to develop the concepts of discriminants, 
trace pairings and lattices. 
[StewTa, Sections 2.2, 2.5 and bits of 2.4].
<p>
<dt>4. 1st &amp; 3rd February:
<dd>We proved that the ring of integers of a number field <i>K</i> 
is a free abelian group, generated by a basis of <i>K</i> over <b>Q</b>. 
We defined cyclotomic fields <b>Q</b>(<i>&zeta;<sub>n</sub></i>), 
computed their discriminants for prime powers <i>n</i> and their 
rings of integers for <i>n</i> prime. We also computed the ring of integers
of <b>Q</b>(<sup>3</sup>&radic;2). 
[StewTa, Sections 2.4, 3.2 and bits of 2.6].
<p>
<dt>5. 8th and 10th February:
<dd>We defined Euclidean domains and proved that these are PIDs and thus UFDs.
Examples were given in real and imaginary quadratic cases.  We also defined
Dedekind domains and proved that the ring of integers of a number field is Dedekind.
Fractional ideals and invertible fractional ideals of domains were defined as well.
[StewTa, Sections 4.6, 4.7 and bits of 5.2].
<p>
<dt>6. 15th and 17th February:
<dd>We stated the main theorem on Dedekind domains: a domain R is Dedekind 
iff every non-zero fractional ideal is invertible iff every non-zero ideal has
a unique factorisation into prime ideals (wrt. the ideal product).  
We gave examples to illustrate this theorem and started a proof.
[StewTa, Section 5.2]
<p>
<dt>7. 22nd and 24th February:
<dd>We finished the proof of the relevant part of main theorem 
on Dedekind domains, i.e. in a Dedekind domain, non-zero ideals are invertible
and have a unique factorisation into prime ideals.  We defined the class group 
and class number of a number field.  
We also illustrated how to apply ideal factorisation and class groups to
Diophantine equations.  We defined norms of ideals and proved basic properties
of them.  We also stated the Kummer-Dedekind theorem.
Most of this can be found in [StewTa, Sections 5.2, 5.3, 9.1 and 10.1].
<p>
<dt>8. 1st and 3rd March:
<dd>We proved the relevant parts of the Kummer-Dedekind theorem and gave some examples to illustrate it.
We started the topic 'the geometry of numbers' and saw how the ring of integers of a number field 
can be embedded as a lattice in a Euclidean space in a natural way.
References for these matters are [Stev, Theorem 3.1 and Section 5] and [StewTa, Section 10.1 and Chapter 8].
<p>
<dt>9. 8th and 10th March:
<dd>We applied the geometry of numbers to obtain lower bounds for discriminants of number fields and to prove
that class groups of number fields are finite.  We gave some examples of class group computations.
We also formulated Dirichlet's Unit Theorem and started a proof of it.  
[Stev, Section 5] and [StewTa, Sections 9.2, 9.3 and Appendix B.4].
