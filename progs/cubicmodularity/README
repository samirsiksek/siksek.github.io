The Magma programs in this folder are for verifying the computations in the paper:

Elliptic curves over totally real cubic fields are modular

by Derickx, Najman and Siksek

There are two Magma files:

Xb5b7.m		This verifies the computations in Section 5 of the paper.
Xb5ns7.m 	This verifies the computations in Sections 6 and 7 of the paper.
