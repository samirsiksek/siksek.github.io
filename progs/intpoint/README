"Integral Points on Hyperelliptic Curves"
by Y. Bugeaud, M. Mignotte, S. Siksek, M. Stoll and Sz. Tengely


In this directory there are five MAGMA programs for verifying
the computations in the above paper:


bicocurve.magma   : "computations for Theorem 2, (y choose 2)=(x choose 5)"
bounds.m  : "computes Baker's bounds for log(x)"
integralpoints.magma : "computations for Theorem 1, y^2-y=x^5-x" 
MW1.m  : "Mordell-Weil sieves intrinsics"
MWdemo.magma : "Mordell-Weil Sieve functions"

To check the computations, load either bicocurve.magma or integralpoints.magma.

WARNING: bicocurve.magma needs at least 2GB of RAM.
